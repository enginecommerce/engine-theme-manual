# Clone, Copy, Paste, Profit

Follow these steps to publish your first site theme. We've created these tools to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

## Start With Building Blocks Theme

We recommend you start by cloning our [Building Blocks Theme][building_blocks_theme_url]. It contains all the best-practice ecommerce features recommended by the team at Engine.

You can clone it with Git or [download a ZIP file][building_blocks_theme_zip].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enginecommerce/building-blocks-theme.git
```

# About Theme Files and Directory Structures

* All files are optional
* when files are not present in the theme, the store site will use default templates.
* You can add as many custom files or folders you want

The complete directory structure of an Engine theme looks like this:

```text
ðŸ“‚ /
â”œ- ðŸ“‚ engine_cms
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ categories
|  â””- ðŸ“‚ posts
â”œ- ðŸ“‚ store
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ checkout
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ errors
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ home
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ layouts
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ orders
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ products
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ shared
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ taxons
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_passwords
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_registrations
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_sessions
|  â””- ðŸ“‚ user
â””- ðŸ“‚ theme_assets
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ fonts
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ img
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ js
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ scss
   â”œ- ðŸ“„ settings_data.json
   â””- ðŸ“„ settings_schema.json
```

## Use Liquid Templates

Use the [Liquid template language][liquid_reference_url] to edit your Engine Storefront theme.

Consult the [Liquid Drop Reference][liquid_drop_reference_link] of this guide to learn what object properties are available within templates

## Use SCSS over CSS

## Upload Your Theme to Your Store

Once you're finished making edits to your theme, compress all top-level folders in your theme directory together into a ZIP file.

From your store's admin, visit **Theme** > **Theme Editor**, and click the **"New Theme"** button in the top bar.
