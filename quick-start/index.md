## Guide Overview
{:.no_toc}

***Before we begin, are you an agency partner? If not, you can still follow along with our open-source [Building Blocks theme][building_blocks_theme_url]; however this guide is meant to help partners with Sandbox access develop and launch sites quickly. If you're not already part of our free agency partner program, [reach out to us][agency_partners_url] to start developing and sharing revenue on the Engine Commerce Platform.***

The Engine Commerce Platform allows you to launch an ecommerce store with robust marketing features without plugin soup. A basic understanding of Git, HTML, and Liquid is ideal.

## Start With Building Blocks Theme

We recommend you start by cloning our [Building Blocks Theme][building_blocks_theme_url]. It contains all the best-practice ecommerce features recommended by the team at Engine.

You can clone it with Git or [download a ZIP file][building_blocks_theme_zip].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enginecommerce/building-blocks-theme.git
```

## About Theme Files and Directory Structures

* All files are optional
* when files are not present in the theme, the store site will use default templates.
* You can add as many custom files or folders you want

The complete directory structure of an Engine theme looks like this:

```text
ðŸ“‚ /
â”œ- ðŸ“‚ engine_cms
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ categories
|  â””- ðŸ“‚ posts
â”œ- ðŸ“‚ store
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ checkout
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ errors
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ home
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ layouts
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ orders
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ products
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ shared
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ taxons
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_passwords
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_registrations
|  â”œ- ðŸ“‚ user_sessions
|  â””- ðŸ“‚ user
â””- ðŸ“‚ theme_assets
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ fonts
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ img
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ js
   â”œ- ðŸ“‚ scss
   â”œ- ðŸ“„ settings_data.json
   â””- ðŸ“„ settings_schema.json
```

## Use Liquid Templates

Use the [Liquid template language][liquid_reference_url] to edit your Engine Storefront theme.

Consult the [Liquid Drop Reference][liquid_drop_reference_link] of this guide to learn what object properties are available within templates

## Use SCSS over CSS

Engine themes prefer SCSS over CSS (/*ahem/* because developers prefer SCSS over CSS)

## Upload Your Theme to Your Store

Once you're finished making edits to your theme, compress all top-level folders in your theme directory together into a ZIP file.

From your store's admin, visit **Theme** > **Theme Editor**, and click the **"New Theme"** button in the top bar.

## Connect With the Engine Commerce Team on Slack
