## Webhooks

In addition to our REST API, we also offer a webhooks interface for clients who
need more interactive access to events occurring on the store. Our webhooks are
based on the REST Hooks convention (https://resthooks.org/). We support the
following hook events within Engine:

* `carton_shipped`: occurs when a carton is marked as shipped.
* `order_cancelled`: occurs when an order is marked as cancelled
* `order_completed`: occurs when a customer completes the checkout process for an order
* `order_inventory_cancelled`: occurs when an item on an order is cancelled from that order
* `product_updated`: occurs when a product's information changes
* `product_viewed`: occurs when a product page is viewed
* `reimbursement_failed`: occurs when a return reimbursement fails to process
* `reimbursement_succeeded`: occurs when a return reimbursement processes successfully
