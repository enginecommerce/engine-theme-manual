## What is Building Blocks?

The Building Blocks theme is a fully functioning Engine Theme that gets you
started building with sensible defaults. Using Building Blocks garauntees that
the most important parts of your theme work out of the gate, and allows you to
skip writing the boilerplate code that every theme will share.

## Building Blocks is Open Source

Engine maintains the Building Blocks theme and will support it, but we welcome
community contributions that make the starter theme more complete or easier to
use.

You can fork the [Building Blocks repository on GitHub](https://github.com/enginecommerce/building-blocks-theme).

## Use Building Blocks

Every Engine store should come with Building Blocks pre-installed and set as
the default theme. You can make changes to the theme from the code editor in
the Engine admin area, or you can follow along locally and upload the finished
project as a zip file.
