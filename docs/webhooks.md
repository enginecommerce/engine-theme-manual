Our webhooks are based on the [REST Hooks convention](https://resthooks.org/). We support the following hook events within Engine:

* `carton_shipped`: occurs when a carton is marked as shipped.
* `order_cancelled`: occurs when an order is marked as cancelled
* `order_completed`: occurs when a customer completes the checkout process for an order
* `order_inventory_cancelled`: occurs when an item on an order is cancelled from that order
* `product_updated`: occurs when a product's information changes
* `product_viewed`: occurs when a product page is viewed
* `reimbursement_failed`: occurs when a return reimbursement fails to process
* `reimbursement_succeeded`: occurs when a return reimbursement processes successfully
